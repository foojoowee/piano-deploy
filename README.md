# piano-deploy

Overview:

This mini-project is a simple piano simulator, with 21 keys ranging from F2 to E5. 
This project is built using vite + react with some free licensed audio files for the notes.


Usage:

You can play the keys by either clicking on the keys as seen on the screen or pressing the keyboard key (check settings for the default key bindings).
The app now currently supports a single record, press the record button and play the notes you want, and click record again to stop recording.
There is a default piece saved that you can test out when you press "play" (let's see if you can recognize what song it is!)

Project is very straight-forward and basic with react (v18.2.0) and react-dom as its only dependencies. To run it simply use "npm run dev"

Future Development/Improvements:

Currently the app is not supported on mobile. Due to the nature of the app, it might not be feasible to be used on mobile.
Might look to add more features regarding the recording and playing multiple music files. I might even work on a transcriber (similar to synthesia)
Could also bind chords (multiple keys) to a single key binding which might enhance experience.
But, overall using a "computer keyboard" feels bad compared to playing on a normal music keyboard -  this could be just a fun app to mess around on your touch screen tablets.
